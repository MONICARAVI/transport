		<p style=" font-size: 20px">When the College started functioning in the new campus at Pennalur in 1991, the management decided to provide transportation between various parts of Chennai city and the College. Initially eight buses started operating between the college and the city. As the number of courses offered increased, the total strength of the college also increased and now 50 buses are operating from various parts of Chennai to the college. We operate cars for all HODs, Deans and COE.<br><br>The College owns around Fifty buses, One TATA ACE Auto and one ambulance. A transport committee, headed by a Convenor, is formed to take care of the smooth operation of buses. The staff in-charge of the buses ensure the smooth functioning of the buses. The Transport committee meets once in Six months and the Principal and the staff in-charge of the buses attend the meeting.<br><br>Transport is also provided for sports, library, laboratory and late evening classes. On special occasions, buses are utilised for industrial visits and social service activities.</p>
